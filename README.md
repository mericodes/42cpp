# C++ / Object-oriented Programming

These projects serve as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of the C++ programming language. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is emphasized, focusing on the utilization of objectsâ€”instances of classes that encapsulate data and operations. OOP promotes modular, reusable code components, enhancing clarity, maintainability, and scalability.
